# Find a Sitter Frontend

The frontend is written in some of the newest web technologies, using vue.js(as a Single page application) to present data in a beautiful manner.

The searchbar is using fuzzysearch, which gives us the ability to weight the importance of information based on our user (name 2/3, location 1/3)

when Logged in you can:
#### Find a sitter, if you are a "baby"
#### See babies, if you are a "sitter"
#### Give ratings to 1-5 and a message for others to see.
#### View avg rating of users and how many reviews they got.
